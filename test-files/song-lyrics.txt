Life (by Des'ree)

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot dooo

I'm afraid of the dark
'Specially when I'm in a park
And there's no-one else around
Ooh, I get the shivers
I don't want to see a ghost
It's a sight that I fear most
I'd rather have a piece of toast
And watch the evening news

Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot doot dooo
Life, oh life, oh life, oh life
Doo, doot dooo

I'm a superstitious girl
I'm the worst in the world
Never walk under ladders
I keep a rabbit's tail
I'll take you up on a dare
Anytime, anywhere
Name the place, I'll be there
Bungee jumping, I don't care!
(Repeat)

Life, doo, doot dooo
Doo, doot dooo
So after all isâ€¦
